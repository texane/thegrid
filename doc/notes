kolb, will you find the rules?

[ introduction ]

game based on basic elements and rule generator

at the beginning of a party, you do not know the rule. you have to discover by yourself
and exploit them to increase your score. when a rule is discovered, it is replaced by
one another. once discovered, rules have outcomes: score is increased, color are added,
time slows down ... for some rules, outcomes are masked.

[ basic elments ]

basic elements are colored blocks. the player starts with a given number of block per
color. the grid is made of cells that can host a block. a cursor is movable over a grid
to put blocks inside empty cells. blocks on the grid can be taken back in player inventory.
in a multiplayer mode, rules are the same for both players. players do not share the same
screen.

[ game controls ]

[ rule matching indicator ]

number of possible plays to match a given rule: require to evaluate, foreach cell, the
distance of a given rule and keep the nearest one


[ examples of rules ]

rules are all made with the following: if_condition_is_met then execute_statements;

simple rules:
if game_starts, then time is N seconds
if game_starts, then inventory is {R red, G green, B blue} blocks
if score_is(N), then game_ends
if red_is_put, then time accelerates
if 4 blocks aligned, then increase the score
if 4 blocks aligned, then decrease the score
form a shape with blocks
put a block at a distance of N of another block
put a red block near a green one turn it into green one

if a color is surround by another a color

aggregate rules
put a red block at a distance less than N from a red block AND more than M from a blue block
